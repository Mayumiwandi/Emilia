### Deskripsi
Emilia is the main female character in Re:Zero âˆ’ Starting Life in Another World. She is a half-elf with silver hair and purple eyes, kind-hearted, gentle, yet often misunderstood because she resembles the Witch of Envy, Satella.
Emilia possesses ice-elemental magic and has a contract with the great spirit Puck.
Though she appears fragile, she has a strong will and deep empathy, striving to become the ruler of Lugnica and protect the people she loves, especially Subaru.
In addition, Emilia is also cute, cheerful, and innocent, making her an adorably charming character among the cast. ðŸ’œ
